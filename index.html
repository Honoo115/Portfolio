        <h1>A bit of me</h1>
        <h3>
          Greetings! My name is Bryan C Abicht. I am currently learning to be a
          Fullstack Developer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in the Fullstack Flex program at thinkful to
          become a fullstack developer. Coding has been a growing interest to me
          after my recent graduation from Pierce College in the Digital Design
          program where I got to try it out in a few scenarios. The feeling of
          solving puzzles and knowing another art form is what interests me the
          most about coding so far. While coding is not on the agenda you can
          find me either watching sports, playing video games, reading manga, or
          creating digital art. Someday I hope to combine my passion for gaming
          with my creativity in art with coding in order get a job in the gaming
          industry, but this will take a long time and I am fine with that. But
          someday I will make it.

        </div>
        <p>
          This is my first project. The app is a multiple choice quiz based on
          historical events that took place during the Second World War. This
          quiz contains a compilation of Javascript, CSS, and HTML combined
          together to form a quiz complete with color and text feedback, a
          flexible design so that it can be viewed on multiple screen sizes, a
          question + score keeper for progress, and a button to start the quiz
          over from the beginning.
